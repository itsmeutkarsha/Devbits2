This is the backend of Competitive Programming Arena, a Codeforces-inspired platform for hosting custom programming contests. Built with Django Rest Framework, it provides robust APIs to handle user profiles, contest creation, team collaboration, problem integration via the Codeforces API, and real-time leaderboards. Designed to seamlessly integrate with a React frontend, this backend enables competitive programmers to create and participate in custom contests with their friends or teams.
